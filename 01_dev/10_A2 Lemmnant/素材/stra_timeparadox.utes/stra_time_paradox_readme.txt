-----------------------

Move file stra_timeparadox.Porto into ArmA mission folder.
No third party addons required.

And how does it actually work? It's all about negative acctime value.
Look into only trigger in mission for more informations.
And one more thing - you have to be in vehicle when paradox occurs ;)

Have fun.
